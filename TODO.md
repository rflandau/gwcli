- create CSV exclude variant
- create JSON exclude variant
    - currently blocked by an issue in the [Gabs library](https://github.com/Jeffail/gabs). I have a PR open to fix it, but Gabs may be unmaintained, which would suck because it is cool as hell.
- create Table exclude variant

- query editor syntax highlighting
    - need to PR the client library, as it does not currently hit the fold, diag endpoints the web gui uses for syntax highlighting/validation

- store help strings within mother somewhere so we can lazy-compile them rather than regenerating each call
    - negligible difference; there are more important performance tweaks elsewhere

- implement no-color flag
    - I have it stuck in my brain that lipgloss has native support for the [NoColor environment variable](https://no-color.org/), but it does not seem to currently be effectual.
    - This can probably be rememdied by providing lipgloss with the NoColor or 1bit renderer, but you would need to ensure all lipgloss styles use this renderer, likely as a new singleton tightly coupled with stylesheet.

- tree/query/actor.go's BurnFirstView...
    - There is a substantial exploration of the issue in BurnFirstView()

- search around for a BubbleTea rendering fix for window size messages in non-altmode.
    - currently, get artefacting above most recent draw
    - this may be beyond the capabilties of Bubble Tea (without always running in alt buffer mode or claiming the entire terminal on boot some other way), as so many terminal applications artefact badly on resize (at least for no-longer-controlled elements).

- BUG: DS's results lose the alternating color if the start of the entry is cut off (aka: the termainl escape characters get cut off at the start)

- support X-Y notation in records downloading via DS

- support RecordsPerPage flag/option in datascope for larger/higher-density displays
    - currently pinned at 25, which can leave a lot of empty space if the terminal is full-screened
    - could also have it adjust page count and records per page dynamically with WindowSizeMessages

- add debouncer to DS to reduce lag when holding a key
    - native debouncer bubble, though I do not have any experience using the debouncer

- utilize DataScope's table's native filtering
    - provide keybind and external ("API") filter TI
        - the external API is best as the table has no idea where the viewport is, so the filter would need to be a part of the viewport to move with it.
    - will require utilizing the table's update method, which is currently not called
        - somewhat conflicts with the viewport wrapper
        - remember to disable the table's keybinds, other than filtering

- support more FieldTypes (radio buttons, checkboxes) in scaffold create

- add aliases to the dynamic search generation at Mother's prompt

- `extractor create`: figure out how to support dynamic module suggestion based on current tags (as the web GUI does)
    - `ExploreGenerate()` returns a map where the keys are extraction modules, but it appears to be a costly operation to then only use the keys (module names).
        - There must be a better way to filter the list of module names.
    - Suggestions would need to automatically update whenever a new, valid tag is punched into the tags TI
        - this TI must be aware of the other TI, meaning the function signature of this customTI feature likely needs references to other parts of the createModel.
            - might be more trouble than it is worth, as we are trying to operate off the generic scaffoldcreate.

- Differentiate gravwell client library between unrecoverables and invalids
    - A number of code snippets in gwcli differentiate between "invalid parameters" and "an unrecoverable error". The former is displayed to the user, the latter is logged and gwcli gracefully returns to Mother. The client library does not make this differentiation, through no fault of its own; this is just due to different design philosophies. Therefore, all errors returned by the Client library are treated as unrecoverable. For example, scaffoldedit has implementors return `invalid` or `err` in the update function they supply. Macro edit's update function, Client.UpdateMacro() returns an error. These are always returned as `err`, even though many are validation errors (such as "name cannot have spaces"). More granular differentiation would be really nice (and also more consistent) from a user perspective. Implementing these changes mean either changing the Client library, performing pre-checks for known validation issues (as Macro edit's update function does for the spaces issue), or digging into the errors returned to check for known validation errors. The first one isn't reasonably because the client library shouldn't have to care about this use case. The second one isn't ideal because it duplicates validation. Finally, the third one is arguably the least desirable because it violates the principles of opaque error handling([1](https://dave.cheney.net/2016/04/27/dont-just-check-errors-handle-them-gracefully), [2](https://dave.cheney.net/2016/04/07/constant-errors)) and is also likely to get very slow very quickly ([3](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-05-31-benchmarking-go-error-handling/)).

- Performance Profiling and optimization
    - gwcli was developed on two fairly high performance machines and the focus was on completeness, rather than optimization. A coarse performance pass, especially in the realm of startup, would likely be benefitial for lower end machines. Building the command tree can likely be parallelized, at the very least.
